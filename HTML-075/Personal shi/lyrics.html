            [Intro]
   Falling in love with you
Is the easiest thing that I've ever done
Falling for someone new
Was the dangerous thing
I just wanna die, die for someone
Any-anyone, is that you?
Beat it 'til it's bad, make it happy, sad
Bring it back to black, is that you?
Sirens on the inside-side-side-side-side-side-side-side-side
It's the last thing on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Falling in love with you
Is the dirtiest thing that I've ever done
Falling to sleep with you
What a dangerous thing that I put me through
If you can cross your heart and hope to die
Then, I can learn to live and love the lie
That falling in love with you
Is the dirtiest thing, the dirtiest thing
I've got plenty dirty laundry here, it won't disappear
Made some bad decisions, now I wanna hide away
Heavy, I can feel the fear
Cupid's getting bored in here
Sometimes wanna shed a tear
Jumped off with no landing gear
Pain is on the inside-side-side-side-side-side-side-side
It's repeating on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Falling in love with you
Is the dirtiest thing that I've ever done
Falling to sleep with you
What a dangerous thing that I put me through
If you can cross your heart and hope to die
Then, I can learn to live and love the lie
That falling in love with you
Is the dirtiest thing, the dirtiest thing
Sirens on the-
It's the last thing on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Falling in love with you
Is the dirtiest thing that I've ever done
Falling to sleep with you
What a dangerous thing that I put me through
